My name is Michael Rozsypal I am a recent Computer Science Graduate from California State University Fullerton. I have been a full time student from August 2014 - May 2020.
I have a great interest in computer science and computers in general. My father introduced me to computer games as early as five years old and I have not stopped being interested since then. 


I am currently seeking work in any Computer Science related field. I have mainly focused my studies on the cyber security field but I am open to any new experiences please do not hesitate to contact me.
